    "Upgrading entire legacy systems, for example ERP systems, can seem complicated, time-consuming, and expensive due to various factors such as outdated governance requirements, spaghetti code, and dated workarounds and fixes. In such a case, migrating to the cloud or undertaking other modernization initiatives will have a significant time and money cost. To circumvent this, technology can enable this to be streamlined, for example by using sophisticated algorithms to understand which area of an ERP system will have the most significant impact on the bottom line. Using tools, you can even recode critical applications (leaving your existing ERP system intact) or replatform them in ways that minimize technical debt. The crux of the matter is that applications and legacy systems should be modernized so that they add value to your business instead of being a liability to it. With tightening budgets in the midst of a slowed economy, the pressure will be on for organizations to make the most use of their existing assets. Because of this, the digitalization wave is set to gain momentum in 2021",

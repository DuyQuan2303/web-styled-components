    "Upgrading entire legacy systems, for example ERP systems, can seem complicated, time-consuming, and expensive due to various factors such as outdated governance requirements, spaghetti code, and dated workarounds and fixes. In such a case, migrating to the cloud or undertaking other modernization initiatives will have a significant time and money cost. To circumvent this, technology can enable this to be streamlined, for example by using sophisticated algorithms to understand which area of an ERP system will have the most significant impact on the bottom line. Using tools, you can even recode critical applications (leaving your existing ERP system intact) or replatform them in ways that minimize technical debt. The crux of the matter is that applications and legacy systems should be modernized so that they add value to your business instead of being a liability to it. With tightening budgets in the midst of a slowed economy, the pressure will be on for organizations to make the most use of their existing assets. Because of this, the digitalization wave is set to gain momentum in 2021",

  If you’re trying to advance in your career or change careers completely and need to master a programming language, you might wonder which one to learn. After all, it will take time and money to learn the language, so you want to make the right choice.\

  Several considerations come into play when making your decision, like the difficulty level you’re willing to learn, the knowledge you already possess that align with your existing coding skills, or your reasons for learning a top programming language.\
  Whether you want to develop a mobile application, get certification for programming knowledge, or learn new skills, you need to learn the right programming language.",
